# Gratitude Bot
## Add the bot to your server!
This is as easy as clicking [here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1094831789442343002&scope=applications.commands)!

## What is this bot?
This bot will randomly remind registered users to keep a [gratitude journal](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Gratitude_journal), right within Discord!  
It runs on [Cloudflare workers](https://workers.dev/), and is very simple to use:
1. Use `/start` to begin keeping your journal
1. Use `/entry` to add entries even if the bot didn't send you a reminder yet
1. Use `/stop` to stop receiving reminders

And that's it! New features will be added in the future, and I'm happy to receive [suggestions](https://github.com/Fittiboy/gratitude/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=feature_request.md&title=Feature+request%21)!
I would be grateful for any bugs you [report](https://github.com/Fittiboy/gratitude/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=bug_report.md&title=Bug+report%21) as well!

### Self-hosting
Gratitude bot can hopefully run on the [free plan](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/pricing/), so self-hosting incurs no cost past time spent setting up
More information will be available here once the bot has become usable.
