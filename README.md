# Gratitude Bot
This is a bot that will randomly remind registered users to keep a [gratitude journal](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Gratitude_journal), right within the bot itself.
It runs on [Cloudflare workers](https://workers.dev/), and is currently not yet finished.

Gratitude bot can run on the [free plan](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/pricing/), so self-hosting incurs no cost past time spent setting up
More information will be available here once the bot has become usable.
